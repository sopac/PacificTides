# Pacific Tides - Android App

Pacific Tide Prediction Calendars are generated by the Australian-funded Climate and Oceans Support Program in the Pacific (COSPPac) and are now being designed and produced in the region by the Pacific Community (SPC)’s Ocean and Tides Knowledge Unit.

The calendar predictions are calculated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Tidal Unit with information from the Pacific Sea Level Monitoring stations and a few additional tide gauges around the region.

In order to ensure desimination of the tide calendars beyond the National Meteorological Service offices and other key ocean stakeholders throughout the region, an Android app has been developed with local yearly tide tables embedded.

2017 Tide Prediction Calendars are available for 19 locations in 14 countries: Rarotonga, Cook Islands; Pohnpei Harbor, Federated States of Micronesia; Lautoka, Fiji; Suva, Fiji; Betio, Kiribati; Majuro, Marshall Islands; Aiwo, Nauru; Alofi, Niue; Malakal, Palau;  Lombrum, Papua New Guinea; Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; Apia, Samoa; Honiara Solomon Islands; Lata Wharf, Solomon Islands; Tarekukure Wharf, Solomon Islands; Nuku’alofa, Tonga; Funafuti, Tuvalu; Port Vila, Vanuatu; Luganville, Vanuatu.

Predictions can also be downloaded from the Bureau website @ http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/projects/spslcmp/tidecalendars.shtml
